Mr. X Mobile App
==================

**Mr. X** is a Compose Multiplatform app built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It
follows Material3 design and Android development best practices and is intended to be a
hobby and showcase project.

The app is currently in development and only available to a closed circle of testers.  

# Features

**Mr. X** is a question and answer based game in which a host has to think of a person and
players have to figure out who the host thought of based on a system of rules. For more information
please visit the tutorial within the app. Users can create and join games to play Mr. X with other players.
